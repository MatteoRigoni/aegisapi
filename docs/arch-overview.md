# AegisAPI â€” Architecture Overview

> An ASP.NET Core (.NET 8) + YARP security gateway with JWT/API key authentication, claim-based authorization, rate limiting, schema validation, WAF protections, anomaly detection, **AI incident summarization**, and end-to-end observability via OpenTelemetry. Future work includes OPA/Rego policies and Azure AD integration. Targets AKS for data plane, GitHub Actions for CI, Cosign/Trivy/CodeQL for supply chain, and Helm for delivery.

## 1) Request Flow (Data Plane)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Client["Client / Partner"] -->|"HTTPS (TLS1.2plus)"| E["Edge: Azure Front Door / AppGW WAF"]
    E --> G["Gateway (YARP, .NET 8)"]
    subgraph "YARP Pipeline (per-request)"
      A1["AuthN: JWT or API Key"] --> A2["AuthZ: Claim Policy"]
      A2 --> A3["Rate Limit (token bucket, in-memory)"]
      A3 --> A4["Schema Validation (OpenAPI/JSON Schema)"]
      A4 --> A5["WAF Checks (regex for SQLi/XSS/SSRF/Path Traversal)"]
    end
    G -->|"mTLS / JWT"| Svc["Backend Services"]
```

### Notes

- **Authentication**: JWT bearer tokens or API keys. OIDC integration is planned.
- **Authorization**: simple claim-based policy. OPA sidecar is planned.
- **Rate Limiting**: in-memory token bucket.
- **Resilience**: outbound calls use Polly for retries, timeouts, and circuit breakers.

## 2) Control Plane & OPA Decision Point (planned)

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph "GitOps and CI/CD"
    Repo["Policies Repo (Rego)"] --> CI["GitHub Actions: lint, test, Checkov"]
    CI --> Bundle["OPA Bundle (OCI Artifact)"]
    CI --> SBOM["SBOM and Sign (Syft / Cosign)"]
  end

  Bundle -->|"pull"| OPASidecar["OPA Sidecar at Gateway"]
  OPASidecar <-->|"/v1/data/aegis/allow"| YARPMW["YARP AuthZ Middleware"]

  subgraph "Runtime Management"
    ADM["Admin Portal: policy PRs, approvals"]
    Tele["Telemetry: OTel, traces, logs, metrics"]
  end

  Tele --> ADM
  ADM --> Repo
```

### Notes

- Policies are versioned, tested, and published as bundles (OCI). Gateways pull bundles on start and periodically. 
- Decision point stays in the gateway (low latency, fail-closed with cached bundles). 

## 3) AI Summarizer Service

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    OTel["OTel Collector"] --> EH["Event Hub or Kafka"]
    EH --> ADSvc["Anomaly Detector (rules and ML)"]
    ADSvc --> Summ["AI Summarizer Service (.NET and Azure OpenAI)"]
    Summ --> GH["GitHub PR Bot"]
    Summ --> Ops["Teams or Email Pager Alerts"]
```

### Notes

- Summarizes incident context (recent request bundles) using an LLM.
- Can draft remediation PRs (e.g., tighten policy, add rate-limit, update schema). Requires human approval. *(planned)*

## 4) Telemetry (OpenTelemetry)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    App["Gateway and Services (OTel SDK)"] --> Coll["OTel Collector (DaemonSet)"]
    Coll -->|"OTLP"| AM["Azure Monitor and Application Insights"]
    Coll -->|"OTLP"| Logs["Log Analytics"]
    Coll -->|"OTLP"| Jaeger["Jaeger or Tempo (optional)"]
    Coll -->|"Prom"| Prom["Prometheus or Managed Prom"]
```

### Notes

- Unified tracing/metrics/logs with baggage/attributes scrubbed of PII.
- Tail-based sampling for high-QOS transactions.

### Security Controls (high level)

- **Zero Trust**: mutual TLS to backends; audience/issuer checks on JWTs. Azure AD app registrations are planned.
- **Defense in Depth**: Edge WAF + schema validation + rate limits. OPA policies are planned.
- **Secrets**: Azure Key Vault; CSI Secret Store in AKS; short-lived credentials.
- **Supply Chain**: Cosign-signed images & bundles, SBOM attestation; Trivy/Checkov/CodeQL in CI.
- **Isolation**: Namespaces & NetworkPolicies; minimal pod capabilities; read-only filesystem.

### Assumptions

- Azure subscription with AAD, AKS, Key Vault, Managed Grafana/Monitor available.
- Azure OpenAI access approved (deployment + responsible AI guardrails).
- Backends expose OpenAPI specs (>= 3.0) for validation.

### Trade-offs

- YARP (managed in-proc) vs Envoy (feature-rich xDS): simpler ops vs fewer native filters; OPA sidecar compensates.
- AKS vs ACA: AKS gives maximum control; higher ops overhead vs ACA.
- Dual WAF (edge + local): increases protection and complexity.
