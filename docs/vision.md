# Vision – AegisAPI



## One-liner

**AegisAPI secures your APIs with adaptive zero-trust defenses, AI anomaly detection, and self-healing automation.**



## Mission

To provide organizations with a **production-grade API security gateway** that is simple to adopt, integrates natively with modern DevSecOps practices, and continuously improves resilience through AI-driven insights and automated remediation.



## Why AegisAPI

- Traditional gateways focus on routing, but **security is bolt-on**.  

- WAFs block patterns but struggle with modern API abuse.  

- AI anomaly detection plus **auto-PR pipelines** reduce both *blast radius* and *time to recovery*.  



## Core Differentiators

1. **Security-first architecture** – built on YARP + .NET 8 with minimal attack surface.  

2. **AI-augmented defense** – summarize anomalies, propose PRs, reduce ops burden.  

3. **Developer-centric workflows** – GitHub Actions, IaC (Terraform/Bicep), and Helm for fast iteration.  

4. **Observability by default** – OpenTelemetry, k6 load tests, and ZAP security regression.  



## Long-term Vision

AegisAPI aims to become the **reference open-source secure API gateway** that:  

- Acts as a **trust layer** between services and external clients.  

- Provides **continuous compliance evidence** (attestation, signed SBOMs).  

- Embeds **resilience automation** into the software lifecycle.
